                <h3>Export data before Removal</h3>
                <p>
                    SweepPress Pro now can export data that will be removed into SQL formatted backup files.
                    The export can be done for most of the sweepers, Options and Sitemeta management and all Metadata Management panels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All backup files are stored in protected directory, and you can download them via hosting file manager or FTP.
                    Each backup SQL can be imported back via any MySQL management tool, like PHPMyAdmin which is usually available on every server.
